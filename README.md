Futurtainment Project
About the Project:
As fullstack developers, we embarked on the creation of Futurtainment, an event management application designed to revolutionize how users browse, book, and manage events online. Our aim was to create a user-friendly and intuitive platform that caters to both event attendees and administrators, providing a seamless experience for all.

Getting Started:
Prerequisites:
Git
Node.js
NPM
How to Install:
React Bootstrap <br> npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
React Router DOM <br> npm i react-router-dom
Axios <br> npm i axios
Features and Functionality:
User-Facing Pages:
Home Page:

Displays top events with a search bar for easy event discovery.
Users can browse events based on categories, dates, and popularity.
Event Details Page:

Detailed view of individual events including title, description, date, time, venue, seats, and ticket price.
Users can like and comment on events to engage with other attendees.
Booking Page:

Allows users to book tickets for selected events.
Users can select the number of tickets and proceed to payment.
User Profile Page:

Displays user's booking history and liked events.
Users can update their personal information and preferences.
Admin Dashboard:
Event Management:

Admins can add new events by filling out a form with details like title, description, date, time, venue, seats, and ticket price.
Edit existing events and delete events as necessary.
Activity Logs:

Real-time activity logs that display actions performed by admins, such as adding, updating, and deleting events.
Logs are updated dynamically and displayed on the admin dashboard.
Backend Integration:
API Endpoints:

Utilizes RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations.
Endpoints include:
GET /api/events - Fetch all events
POST /api/events - Create a new event
PATCH /api/events/:id - Update an existing event
DELETE /api/events/:id - Delete an event
Database:

MongoDB is used to store event data and user interactions.
Mongoose is used for schema definition and interaction with MongoDB.
Concept Process:
Ideation:
Our project began with a thorough brainstorming session where we identified the key functionalities required for an event management system. We focused on creating a user-friendly interface that addressed common pain points in existing solutions.

User-side Wireframes:
We designed wireframes to map out the user journey and ensure a seamless experience across all pages. These wireframes guided our development process and ensured that all features were implemented effectively.







Development Process
Highlights
We found the experience of working on this project to be immensely rewarding. One of the key highlights was learning how to work as a team to complete a fully functional and deployment-ready website.

Another aspect of the project that we found particularly enjoyable was the chance to further improve our understanding of MERN stack development as well as React. As individuals who have worked with APIs in the past, we were already familiar with the basic concepts and principles involved. However, this project allowed us to delve deeper into the topic and gain a more nuanced understanding of how APIs work, how to use them effectively, and how to troubleshoot issues that might arise. By creating our own API, we gained further insight into how they are structured.

Challenges
Throughout this project, we encountered several obstacles that stretched our skill sets and took us beyond our familiar territory. Among these challenges, a particularly noteworthy hurdle was uploading images onto our API.

While the project undoubtedly presented substantial challenges, we view it as an invaluable learning journey. Navigating the complexities tied to the API and charts forced us to expand our developer capabilities and gain novel problem-solving insights. Reflecting on the project, a sense of accomplishment fills us as we consider what we managed to achieve. We eagerly anticipate applying these newfound lessons to upcoming ventures and obstacles.

Future Implementation
Reflecting on our work on this project, there are several areas where we feel there is room for improvement and further development. One of the key areas where we would like to focus in the future is on stabilizing the code and improving consistency. While we were able to get the code working effectively for the purposes of this project, we feel that there is room for improvement in terms of streamlining the code, making it more efficient, and reducing redundancies. In addition, we would like to develop a more consistent coding style when working in a group, to make the code more accessible to others and easier to maintain over time.

Another area where we would like to expand and enhance the project is in making it more interactive and engaging for users. While the website is functional and provides a useful service, we believe that there is room to add more interactivity and animation to the site, in order to make it more visually appealing and engaging for users. This might involve developing new features and functionalities, such as interactive maps or dynamic data visualizations, or adding subtle animations and effects to various elements of the site.

Conclusion
This project has been an incredible learning experience for us, and we are truly grateful for the opportunity to work on it. Throughout the course of the project, we have learned so much, from technical skills to project management and collaboration.

Working on this project has allowed us to put into practice many of the concepts and techniques we have learned in our studies, and it has also challenged us to expand our knowledge and skills. From developing the initial idea to designing and implementing the project, we have gained a deeper understanding of the software development process and the importance of effective communication and teamwork.

We are particularly proud of the progress we have made in developing our programming skills. We have also gained a greater appreciation for the importance of testing and debugging, and how these skills are critical to developing high-quality software.

Overall, this project has been an incredibly fulfilling experience, and we are eager to continue working on it and implementing new features and improvements in the future. We believe that this project has not only helped us to develop our technical skills but has also given us valuable experience working in a team environment and managing a project from start to finish. We are excited to take these skills and experiences with us as we move forward in our careers, and we are confident that they will serve us well in whatever challenges lie ahead.
